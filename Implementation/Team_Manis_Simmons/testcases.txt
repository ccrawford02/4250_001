1. Positive integers input for both prompts
Precondition: user is prompted and input is awaited
Action: A positive integer is input
Postcondition: The program runs until a final single digit number is displayed

2. Negative integer is input
Precondition: user is prompted and input is awaited
Action: A negative integer is input
Postcondition: An error message is output and the user is reprompted to re-enter the number

3. A decimal number is input
Precondition: user is prompted and input is awaited
Action: A decimal number is input
Postcondition: An error message is output and the user is reprompted to re-enter the number

4. A non number is input
Precondition: user is prompted and input is awaited
Action: A non number is input
Postcondition: An error message is output and the user is reprompted to re-enter the number

5. The user presses the enter button without entering anything
Precondition: user is prompted and input is awaited
Action: Nothing is input and enter is pressed
Postcondition: An error message is output and the user is reprompted to re-enter the number

6. A correct input is inputted for the first number but a negative number is entered for the second
Precondition: A correct input has been entered and the user is prompted for the second input
Action: A negative integer is input
Postcondition: An error message is output and the user is reprompted to re-enter the number

7. A correct input is inputted for the first number but a decimal number is entered for the second
Precondition: A correct input has been entered and the user is prompted for the second input
Action: A decimal number is input
Postcondition: An error message is output and the user is reprompted to re-enter the number

8. A correct input is inputted for the first number but a non number is entered for the second
Precondition: A correct input has been entered and the user is prompted for the second input
Action: A non number is input
Postcondition: An error message is output and the user is reprompted to re-enter the number

9. A correct input is inputted for the first number but only enter is pressed for the second
Precondition: A correct input has been entered and the user is prompted for the second input
Action: enter key is pressed
Postcondition: An error message is output and the user is reprompted to re-enter the number

10. Both inputs add up to a single digit number
Precondition: The user is prompted to enter the positive integers
Action: The user enters two single digit numbers that add up to a single digit number
Postcondition: That sum of the two numbers entered is returned as the final number

11. Inputs add up to a number with more than one digit
Precondition: The user is prompted to enter the positive integers
Action: The user enters two numbers that add up to a number with greater than one digit
Postcondition: the number is split and it's LSD is added to its remaining most significant digits,
this is repeated through recursion until a single digit number is presented as the final number

12. Incorrect inputs then correct inputs
Precondition: The user is prompted to enter the positive integers
Action: The user enters Incorrect inputs, then enters correct inputs
Postcondition: The program runs and splits the correct input numbers and recurses until a single digit number is presented
as the final number.
