Friday
Resumed working on providing feedback to SE I essays ~7:30am,
Drove to campus for 11am-1pm mtg about ABET (worked out of my office until mtg started)
	Tried hard not to be disruptive during the meeting. I'm not sure I was successful.
Worked all afternoon and into the evening to finish the SE I essays. (E; grades due Sunday)
Beaver wall has been barely repaired the last 3 days. Maybe it's giving up.
Did some of my wife's chores because she was busy with the refugee family (E)
Tried to relax but then I got the mail and saw 3 letters from the state; all of which showed different combinations of benefits and two were dated the same day so I have no idea where I stand on benefits again. My wife calmed me down and said she will call the state next week to get their side and maybe it's all okay. 
Reviewed SE I material for Monday, updated my notes.
I'm going to take a more relaxed approach to status reports this weekend. 
Ordered Chinese food because we both had very busy days
Checked emails periodically throughout the evening in case a student needed something time critical

Saturday
Finished SE 1 section 2 and section 1 reports (took most of the morning and afternoon)
Dealt with beaver issue. The beaver continues to do less repairs.
Added pine shaving bedding to the chicken coop so the chickens can stay warm on colder nights without a heat lamp.
Closed the chickens up in the coop once it got dark.
	Once we train them to go in at night, they'll do this on their own.
	My wife put a bowl of food in the coop in the evening to lure them in (putting away their normal feeder too)
Ate most of the leftover chinese food (makes the $75 order look more reasonable since it covered 2 dinners)

	just one hour of school stuff (E)
Arrived early to church, setup streaming equipment (still not using new mics)
Stayed after to collect and organize donations for our food shelf (weekly activity; my wife coordinates the daily distribution)
Worked with someone to figure out how the new mics work (E)
	They each have their own receivers, turns out they were all on the same channel and cancelled each other out
	Printed labels on transmitters and receivers so we know which goes to which and what channels each is on
	Wrote up some quick instructions for the priest and deacon on usage of the new mics.
	Sent a text to concerned parties that it was all working now
	Miss most of bell choir practice session 
Refilled the coop feeder and picked up the regular feeders so the chickens would go into the coop
	Didn't close them in this time
Started working on phase II of the chicken fort which will triple their run size.(E)
	Worked out a new design that should give me more headroom in the run without taking any more pallets.
	My wife order two rolls of heavy gauge fencing to put over the top of the fort
Picked up black walnuts with my wife (a nice strolling activity). Collected ~70 gallons of whole walnuts (E)
	(still need to hull them, dry them, and store them for winter)
	Will probably collect this much more again before the season is over
Dug up the last of the potatoes in the garden (two five gallon buckets worth) (E)
	Now I just need to cut down all the weeds and overgrowth, then cover it with a giant tarp for the winter
Disassembled the hot tub and put it away for winter storage, still need to clearn the hot tub deck.(E)
