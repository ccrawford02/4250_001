I am a Senior majoring in Computing and concentrating in Information Systems. I am working in an internship currently at Eastman, there I am currently developing many projects.
These Projects at times involve graphical programming interefaces to allow me to develop an automation to do various manual tasks. I also at times are involved data analytics projects, these also
can involve data visualizations that are created with Microsoft Power BI to help drive business decisions or help management know whats happening at a glance. I am the most familar with 
Microsoft Power Automate, but I also had experience with a couple coding languages as well. Most notably C# and Java. But also have done some tutorials and self learning involving python as well.
