My name is Nicholas Sells, and most of my development experience is with low-level and embedded code. I am proficient with C/C++, C#, SQL, Python, and Javascript. My dream career is developing software for embedded systems, but I am also passionate about web-based applications.
Some of my experiences include:
  Lead Programmer on the ETSU Underwater robotics team (using Arduino and C++)
  Helped develop a VR tracheotomy simulation for the East Tennessee Children's Hospital
  Developed a 2D procedural level generator that runs on a Gameboy Advance.

I have 5 years of experience using Git (CLI) and Github (Web).
