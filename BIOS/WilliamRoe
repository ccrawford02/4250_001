Hi my name is William Roe and I'm a computing major with a concentration in computer science. 
I'm a confident coder and am fluent in C#, Java, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS.
I've done a handful of notable personal projects like a loot tiering system for FFXIV and a companion website for the CSCI 2200 course.
I enjoy computer games and hanging out with friends in Discord in my free time.
