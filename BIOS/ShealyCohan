Hello, my name is Shealy Cohan and I am a Computer Science undergraduate at ETSU. I am on track to graduate in May 2024.

I have strong organizational, time-management, and self-discipline skills.
I am very comfortable with working with GitHub.
I have a lot of coding experience with C#, Java, HTML, and Python, however I feel that I am most experienced with C#.
I have strong skills with Microsoft Excel and enjoy working with data and spreadsheets. 

I currently work in an addiction clinic doing clerical work such as filing and data entry.
I have experience grading assignments for Enabling Business with IS (CSCI 3700) for the Fall 2023 semester.
