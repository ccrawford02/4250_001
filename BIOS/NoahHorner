My name is Noah Horner, I am from Gate City VA, and gradutated from Northeast State with an Associate's in Computing with a concentration in programming.
I later transferred to ETSU and am on track for a Bachelor's in Computing with a concentration in IT.
I am fluent in C#, Java, Python, and DBMS' such as Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
I work full-time as Target Asset Protection so a strength of mine is time-management and communication.
