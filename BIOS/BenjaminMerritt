I am an information systems senior at ETSU and I have expeirence in the following areas that are relevant to this class. My strongsuit is in understanding business processes, gathering requirements, and providing evaluations on software and solutions for clients. I am not a strong programmer, however I understand the logic on a high level and find that I enjoy overseeing development as opposed to diving into technical details. I am a strong communicator and create strong documentation to support the efforts of a team. In simple terms, I take great notes and enjoy project management!
